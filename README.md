# Flight-Price-EDA
The problem statement in this project addresses the volatility of flight ticket prices and the lack of transparency in the airline industry, leaving travelers uncertain about the optimal time to purchase tickets. The project aims to create a predictive model to recommend the best timing for ticket purchases by analyzing historical flight data from Ease My Trip, a popular flight booking platform in India. The project also seeks to debunk common myths in the airline industry and quantify potential savings achievable through informed ticket purchases.

The dataset used for this research comprises 300,261 data points, each with 11 distinct features, providing comprehensive information related to flight bookings in India. These features include airline, flight code, source city, departure time, stops, arrival time, destination city, class, duration, days left, and price. Data collection and preparation involved ensuring data quality, handling missing values, managing outliers, and engineering new features like "Days Left" and categorizing "Departure Time" and "Arrival Time."

The analysis phase used visualization techniques to answer critical business questions and extract valuable insights from the dataset. These insights can influence various aspects of the airline industry, including pricing, passenger preferences, and strategies for enhancing passenger experiences. Key findings and recommendations from the analysis include:

1. Class Preferences and Profitability: While economy class is the most popular choice among passengers, the analysis suggests that the business class is more profitable for airlines, highlighting the importance of optimizing this segment.

2. Vistara and Air India Focus on Business Class: Vistara and Air India primarily target the business class segment, offering relatively expensive tickets and attracting more business-class passengers.

3. Targeting Early-morning and Late-Night Travelers: Passengers with early morning and late-night arrival times represent distinct traveler groups of interest. Encouraging their travel with incentives or promotions can enhance their experience.

4. Encouraging Travel to Different Destination Cities: Promoting less-traveled destination cities with incentives can diversify travel patterns and open new opportunities for airlines.

5. VIP Passengers Prefer Air India: Air India caters to VIP passengers with premium services, and most of them choose the business class, indicating a strong alignment between premium services and class preference.

6. Relationship Between Stops and Duration: There is a significant positive relationship between the number of stops and flight duration, suggesting the potential for creating special offers for travelers seeking longer flights with more stops.

7. Duration and Price Relationship: Contrary to expectations, the analysis found that there isn't a strong relationship between flight duration and ticket prices, giving airlines flexibility in pricing flights of varying durations.

8. Days Left and Price Dynamics: Booking tickets well in advance, ideally more than 10 days before departure, can secure better pricing, as prices tend to increase as the departure date approaches.

In conclusion, the analysis of the dataset has uncovered valuable insights that can significantly impact the strategies and decisions made within the Indian domestic airline market. The recommendations provided benefit both passengers and airline providers, facilitating more informed travel choices and effective service strategies. By focusing on specific traveler segments, offering tailored incentives, and promoting less-traveled destinations, airlines can better serve their customers and improve their competitive position in the Indian domestic airline market. This project empowers consumers to make more informed decisions and optimize their travel expenses while helping airlines enhance their services and profitability.
